# TODO
* add a process that handles besside-ng results -> wpa_cli
* maybe add an info web interface that exposes itself on ngrox etc

# operations
* enable non-free in /etc/apt/sources.list
* packages:
** autossh
** ethtool
** firmware-realtek package (if you have a realtek chipset)
** gpsd gpsd-clients
** libnl-3-dev
** libnl-gen1-3-dev
** libpcap-dev
** libssl-dev
** tcpdump
* clone aircrack-ng from github
** sudo make experimental=true install
* setup rvm, bundler
* drop in your priv key for the atun autossh tunnel 
* add atun to a @reboot line in crontab
* setup ssmtp - http://www.sbprojects.com/projects/raspberrypi/exim4.php

# dev
* reaper should poll for pwa-lite
** don't parse anything 
* hcitool bluetooth
* figure out how to set wpa-roam in /etc/network/interfaces after mon mode?
** on 2016-10-05, set it manually on wlan0, will see what happens
** can we set non-mon interface to wpa-roam with ethtool/net-tools/mii-tool?
** /sbin/wpa_action
** /etc/ifplugd/action.d/action_wpa
** netctl and wpa_actiond for arch linux could be ported to raspbian
** wicd has lots of bad reviews, isn't maintained
* otg mode - http://blog.gbaman.info/?p=699
* write a new tool with airodump-ng lib to deal with mem bloat, etc
* hcitool inq/scan
* airserv-ng
* besside > freetunnel || freevpn
** hostapd
* wpa_cli status
* wpa_cli list_networks
* https://w1.fi/wpa_supplicant/devel/
* Panda PAUD5
** can use up to 620mA at full power?
** http://www.pandawireless.com/download/PWUsersManual_V2.6.15.pdf
* https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt.md
* tried setting sshd ClientAliveInterval to 120
** moving between wifi networks was blocking the autossh restart
* cgps
* gpsmon
* systemctl status gpsd.socket
* parse the beacons too, save that as an offline wigle db
* /usr/sbin/gpsd -N -F /var/run/gpsd.sock /dev/ttyUSB0
* can we channel hop tcpdump or do we need an adapter per channel?
** sudo tcpdump -i wlan2mon -tttt -e -s 256 type mgt subtype probe-req
** sudo iw dev wlan2mon set channel 1
** hopper daemon could do it async, need to figure out the tempo
